Pope has a restful night in hospital - Vatican News - English

After Sunday's church service, Pope Francis said the Church's "sacred values" had been put on hold for now.

The pope, who has been in the hospital for three days, is not believed to be in a critical condition.

He was taken to a non-conventional hospital in the Vatican, where he will be treated for internal bleeding and heart failure.

On Sunday he said there was "no need to talk or talk" about the issue.

"We are deeply distressed by the death of Pope Francis," said Pope Francis II.

"One can only hope we will be able to restore the Church's dignity and integrity."

He added: "Prayers to the people of this world for the good of the Church, and to all those who have suffered through this sad and tragic event."

He said the Pope has been "very very happy", and that "not all the saints" were in pain.
