Car slams into Christmas market in Germany, killing 2 and injuring dozens - The Washington Post

A man who was injured in a terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Germany has been taken to hospital, police said.

The man, believed to be a German citizen, was attacked in an attack in front of a supermarket in the city of LÃ¼beck on Thursday afternoon.

The attacker had apparently been drinking water before the incident, police said.

The attacker was taken in by police, they said.

Germany is a country where a man can be detained without charge for up to a year without charge, with a maximum of six months jail.

Police said it was too early to say if the attack had been carried out by a member of the public.

Police said the attacker is currently wanted for questioning on suspicion of terrorism.

The man was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
