Americans Are Tipping Less Than They Have in Years - The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 6, 2012

Consequently, the number of people 50 years of age or older is down by about one-third over the last 30 years. (This is the longest time the percentage of people over 50 has been below 1 percent.)

The percentage of people over 50 who are living in poverty has been increasing at twice the rate of the U.S. population over the last 30 years.

The percentage of people over 50 who are living in poverty has been declining at least twice the rate of the U.S. population over the last 30 years.

What's most surprising about all this is the fact that it has been going on for far longer than anyone was expecting.
