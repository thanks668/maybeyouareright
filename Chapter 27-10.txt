Apple commits $500B to US manufacturing, including a new AI server facility in Houston - TechCrunch reports.

The tech giant has also committed $500B to the US manufacturing of the Tesla Motors Model S.

The company has also committed $250B to US manufacturing of its Model 3, which is expected to arrive in April.

The move comes as Apple continues to invest heavily in its own carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which is also moving its headquarters to the US.

Apple's investment efforts have been a boon for the company, which has been a target of rival car makers.

In the final quarter of 2015, Apple invested $1.5B from $1.7B. That's a $500B increase, a significant increase over the $1.8B investment it made in 2012.

The company is now expected to make $1.4B in 2016 from the sale of its home-equipment business, according to Reuters.

It is currently looking at a $500B offer from a consortium of three car makers - Bentley, BMW, and Porsche.
