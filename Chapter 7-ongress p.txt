Congress passes RFK bill in surprise move, giving D.C. control of stadium site - The Washington Post

WASHINGTON â€” The House on Tuesday passed a landmark spending bill that would end a decade of stalled legislative efforts that stalled the Obama administration's efforts to expand the nation's stadium business.

The House overwhelmingly approved the bill by a vote of 57-39 as the House of Representatives passed the final bill after a marathon day of debate. It would allow RFK Stadium, the site of the National Football League's World Series, to be built as an open-air venue for the 2018 season.

The White House said Thursday it would support the measure if it could be found in the Senate.

"The House has acted on a bipartisan basis and it will be up to us to decide whether we support or oppose it, but we will work with other chamber members to come up with a compromise to accomplish that," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

The bill is the latest chapter in the stalled negotiations over a $6 billion expansion of the stadium. The government will now need to approve the new stadium's construction and funding.

The legislation, which was expected to pass the House, would reduce the federal subsidy for the development of the site and give local governments the option to sell off the land and lease it to private developers.

The American League's owners have expressed skepticism over how the stadium would be built, saying it would not be able to serve as a "ground-level commercial space that can be used to host the best football games."
