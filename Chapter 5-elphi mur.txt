Delphi murders: Richard Allen sentenced to 130 years for Indiana deaths - BBC.com.au | The Telegraph

Richard Allen, 65, was found guilty of murdering three women from West Virginia on Monday and sentenced to 130 years in prison.

Mr Allen had been serving a 130-year sentence for the murders two years before.

According to prosecutors, Mr Allen, who was first elected to a fourth term at the time, had had a "dissatisfied relationship" with one of the three women.

The victim, a woman named Mariana Jackson, was raped and murdered by Allen in a bedroom in the home of a partner of Mr Allen's.

The victim, whom Mr Allen had previously accused of being sexually abusive, testified to the police that he heard him say to his wife that she was going to murder him.

In a hearing before the supreme court, the judge said: "I agree that as a matter of constitutional law you have the right to say that any of you has a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own home, in the presence of any other person... as a matter of principle."

He also said that the state has no duty to force an individual to commit acts of violence.

The court heard that Mr Allen's first wife, Mariana Jackson, had been at his home when the murders took place.

The judge told the court Mr Allen had denied Mariana Jackson's claims of being sexually abused.

Ms Jackson's wife, who claimed they had been in the home, said: "He said I had been raped by a man.

"My wife claims he said to her, 'I'm going to kill you'.

"This is outrageous. He said he was going to kill me and she said, 'you're not going to tell anyone about it'."

The wife told the court she was told by Mr Allen that she was being held against her will.

Ms Jackson's husband, Robert Allen, was sentenced to a combined life sentence of 12 years and 90 days for the killings.

The judge said: "There was no doubt in my mind that the accused was an honest man who had a long and good relationship with Mariana Jackson
