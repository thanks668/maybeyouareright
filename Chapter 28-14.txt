Saudi oil giant Aramco posts drop in full-year profit, slashes dividend - CNBC

Saudi Aramco shares slipped by 15.7% to $11.36, according to the latest financial report from the Saudi Aramco Corporation.

The company's shares rose to $11.36 after hitting a record low of $11.40.

'SINGLE ROLL'

In the latest report, the Saudi Aramco shares dropped nearly 15.7%, to $19.28, after rising nearly 3% in a year to $19.29 late on Wednesday.

Analysts said the move was seen by some as a sign of a slowdown in global oil prices.

The company posted a 12% decline in its quarterly profit last year, while the share price remained unchanged at $16.30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The company said it would cut production in the second half of this year from the first.

Sales of the oil-exporting country's oil-liquefied water became an increasingly important source of revenue in 2013, as the country became reliant on oil exports.

But the company's shares fell even higher after the country's government cut oil production by more than half in the last two years amid a slump in oil prices.

Analysts said it was a sign that the country was losing market share.
