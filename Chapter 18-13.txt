Bill Oram: The College Football Playoffâ€™s flawed system failed Oregon and needs to be fixed - OregonLive.com

Oregon's top two teams are currently in the top five in the country, but the Ducks have three of the top nine teams in the country - UCLA (21st), USC (21st) and Washington (21st) for the top five. Arizona State is projected to finish fourth, followed by Boise State and Oregon State.

So what does that mean for the Ducks?

"I think they're going to get an opportunity to play in a national title game," Ducks coach Chip Kelly said. "But they're not going to be able to do that because of the way this year's schedule has been played and the way these games are played.

"I think they're going to be able to go out there and do what they've done in this past four years, and if they don't, they're not going to do it."

And if they don't play, Kelly said the Ducks are "just going to have to try to win games and get better and better and better."

The Ducks may not win a national title, but they're not going to win the Pac-12. That's why they're playing at home against the Ducks.

Arizona State is ranked No. 8 in the country, but the Cardinal have won five of their last six games against the Cardinal.
