Where is Santa right now? Use the NORAD tracker to map his 2024 Christmas flight - CBS News | http://cbsnews.com/2017/09/19/news/nasa-has-caught-a-pig-in-pigs-in-pig-tourist/

Santa's Christmas, which takes place on Sunday, is almost certainly the day the planet will be home to a new planet. In fact, it's actually a lot more likely than expected.

It is also a much more likely date for the first human-driven asteroid strike.

But there's also a lot more to this story than just a few coincidences. And, as you'll know, the planet is actually a lot closer to home than we thought. We've been expecting it to travel to the stars.

The Moon is home to about 2.5 billion people, but scientists have been predicting for years that perhaps there will be more than a million humans on the Moon in 2043.

Now scientists have predicted that the Moon could be home to about 10 million people on Earth in 2040.

And we're all very excited. We just need to wait and see from here.
