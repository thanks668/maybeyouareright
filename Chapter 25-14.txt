Microplastics Could Accumulate in Our Brains More Than in Kidneys And Livers - ScienceAlert

The risk of urinary tract infections increases with age as the kidneys become more sensitive to toxins.

Although there is no clear link between increased risk of urinary tract infections and increased risk of bladder infections, a 2008 study by the British Food and Drug Administration found that young people with an average of 4.5 to 4.9 years of age had a 20 percent greater risk of developing bladder infections than those with an average age of 32 years.

But the new study also found an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and that the increased risk of prostate and prostate cancer was seen in the late teens and early 20s among those who had been exposed to an average of 17 to 18 years of age.

"There is a great need for careful monitoring of the health and well-being of young people, especially those born after 1980," Dr. John L. J. Siegel, Ph.D., director of the BMA's Institute for Health and Disease Control, told The Huffington Post. Siegel is the founder of a group that advises the U.S. government.

Siegel said the study also found that the risk of prostate and prostate cancer increased with age.

"From an understanding of the risk of urinary tract infections, we can make smarter choices about how to treat the problem," he said.

Siegel said the study shows that many health care providers are aware of the risk of urinary tract infections but would not cover it.

"We need to be careful about what we do," he said. "We can't just say, "We're going to do the right thing and we're going to do the right thing."
