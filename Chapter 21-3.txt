Former ICE agent is arrested on murder charge in Toronto, says feds

An Edmonton immigration court has ordered that an immigration lawyer was held without bail while in custody following an arrest on a murder charge in Toronto.

Searches into the case by Immigration and Customs Enforcement were hampered by the Canadian border being closed to most travellers.

But ICE said that the judge's order is to allow a lawyer to come and see the lawyer before he or she is released from custody.

The arrest was made during a routine check-up of a man travelling with an illegal immigrant who had arrived in Edmonton in March.

The man, who was identified as Thomas Scott, told CBC News on Thursday he was taken into custody in Yorkville, Ont.

He said he was detained by Toronto police at about 9:30 p.m. on March 15, after he had left the U.S. for a trip to Cuba.

He said he was told by ICE officials that he could be held for one day before being released. That would have meant that he would not be able to get U.S. citizenship.

The arrest is a major setback for an immigration lawyer who has been battling deportation threats since arriving in Canada in 2009.
