Timberwolves pull off big comeback, beat Thunder 131-128 in overtime - Star Tribune

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - One of the biggest upsets of the season for the Richmond Grizzlies will hit the court against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Grizzlies won 122-119 on Friday night at FedExForum in the first game of the season, but the Thunder have played without their star point guard for the past two weeks.

They're tied with the Thunder on a 3-1 run to lift them above.500 and take on the Thunder for the first time since Nov. 8 against the Lakers.

"It's a great feeling," Grizzlies coach Michael Malone said. "We're not going to let it go. We're going to come out of this game with a great start."

Thunder guard Russell Westbrook led the way with 17 points and six assists, but it was his third of the season. The Thunder are 2-29 in his last eight.

"They're going to be a good team,'' Westbrook said. "We've had a few losses that were very hard to beat, but our guys are going to be playing great.''

The Thunder, who have won their last 14 games, were without point guard Deron Williams and the bench.

They are 2-20 in their last 14 against the Thunder.
