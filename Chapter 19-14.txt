China lashes out at US 'coercion' after Panama declines to renew infrastructure agreement - ABC News

The US has sought to distance itself from the Panama Papers scandal.

However, the US government said it would continue to monitor developments in the case.

"We will continue to monitor developments in the Panama Papers as we continue to work on addressing the ongoing issues. We are also pursuing legal options," the White House said in a statement.

"The US Government is committed to working with others to ensure transparency in the U.S. government's actions, including our enforcement of laws and regulations."

Panama had been investigating whether it had used offshore funds to pay for the release of hundreds of thousands of stolen documents from the country's offshore tax havens.

The Panama Papers are the latest in a series of revelations that has left many in the world questioning the value of international law and the justice system.
