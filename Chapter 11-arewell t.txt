Farewell to ‘The Axe Files’ - POLITICO's Tom Hamburger spoke to Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon about his call to take action against the National Security Agency. Wyden is a Democrat who has been a vocal critic of NSA surveillance.

Wyden, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he believes the NSA is "at grave risk" because of a series of new documents that reveal that the agency has been collecting information on Americans' communications.

Wyden's letter addressed to the NSA said:

"The Obama administration's actions in the past several weeks have undermined the foundation of our democracy. They have undermined our ability to keep our national security safe. They have undermined our ability to protect Americans. And they have undermined our ability to protect all Americans. This is unacceptable. It's time to end this administration's unconstitutional surveillance and bulk collection of Americans' communications."

"I am writing to ask you to do the same for your own safety," Wyden said. "Just like you have done in the past, the government is failing to protect the rights of Americans. The NSA has violated the Constitution by collecting and processing information about us all without our prior consent."

"We are also facing renewed calls from some members of Congress to hold the NSA accountable, particularly when it is failing to prevent terrorists from obtaining the kind of information it needs to commit a crime, such as terrorism. So I am asking you to provide me with a letter from Senator Wyden requesting that you send him a letter urging him to investigate the program and to hold the agency accountable."

Wyden's letter to the NSA was sent to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein of California
