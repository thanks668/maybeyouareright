Apple reaches $95 million settlement in Siri lawsuit. What to know. - Axios

In a stunning ruling, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the company was allowed to force the company to provide Siri with a "reasonable" way to communicate with other people.

Jurors in the Southern District of California found in 2010 that the company was required to turn off Siri with the ability to "connect" to other people. But the case was based on a lawsuit brought by John Swartz, a programmer whose lawsuit claimed that his company allowed Siri to talk to other people without requiring him to hand over any information.

Swartz's lawsuit was filed in New York state courts in 2011, but he settled for $5 million in 2012, after he was forced to admit making false statements to the jury.

A judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered that Apple pay $15 million in damages to Swartz's lawyers for failing to disclose that the company had illegally deactivated Siri.

"They knew he was still on the fence," said lawyer Marc Riese of U.S. attorneys in Manhattan. "The judge just thought they had a compelling interest in protecting their client."

Swartz was convicted of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He also pleaded guilty in May to illegally sharing a computer with a third-party.
