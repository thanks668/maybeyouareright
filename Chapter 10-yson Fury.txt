Tyson Fury insists he beat Oleksandr Usyk by 'at least 3 rounds,' lambasts 'early Christmas present' for Usyk - Yahoo Sports

Bolton forward Oleksandr Usyk has been accused of being an 'indifference' to his country and 'disgusting for the Ukrainian people' when he was accused of being a 'hero' in the Ukraine.

Usyk, 30, played for the Black Stars in his first year in Russia, scoring 14 goals and contributing to a total of 21 assists for the Black Stars in 2013-14.

He was also accused of being a 'hero' in a controversial incident on June 26th.

Usyk is now facing allegations of being an 'indifference.'

However, the Black Stars will be hoping for the right response from the club's fans.

The Ukrainian international was asked at the press conference today if he will play in the team's first preseason game in Kiev.

Usyk said: 'I'm not going to play a part in the first game. It will be up to the players.

'There's no need to worry about it. We've only lost a couple of games. We've had to play hard at times, so we're very proud of our players.'

Usyk did not allow a reporter to ask whether he would play in a team tournament in Ukraine
