They wrote obituaries about Jimmy Carter — but died before him - The Washington Post — on its front page, and it was said that Reagan was a "smarter young man" than the president.

The Washington Post said the Reagan campaign had been "put on notice" by the Post's obituary.

"This is the first time that a senator from the states has been put on notice by a publication that has been placed on notice that the national news media has been put on notice for failing to report on the very real and historic scandal that is Hillary Clinton," said the paper.

The paper's editorial board said it was "proud" to have published the obituary.
