Chinese Satellite Burns Up, Drops Debris Over US - Forbes 1/29/2016 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering a proposal to raise the maximum number of broadband Internet access points (i.e., points that allow broadband subscribers to access Internet from other sources). This proposal will include $100 million for the FCC to spend on broadband service (including an additional $100 million for the project) and $100 million for the State of California to purchase broadband service. The proposal also would require the FCC to set up a broadband network to offer broadband service to all of its customers so that they can access Internet from anywhere in the United States. The proposed broadband network would cost $5,000 per gigabit and would provide broadband service to all of its customers. It is important to note that the proposed broadband network would be funded by a $100 million dollar grant from the FCC. The FCC is proposing to establish broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) that will provide broadband service to all of their broadband subscribers by offering broadband Internet access to all of their customers in the same way that they can access Internet from other sources. These ISPs would be: 1) Verizon (Verizon has already been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure for more than 20 years), 2) Comcast (Comcast has been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure for more than 30 years), 3) Time Warner Cable (Time Warner Cable has been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure for more than 40 years), 4) Comcast (Comcast has been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure for more than 40 years), 5) AT&T (AT&T has been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure for more than 40 years), and 6) Comcast (Comcast has been a part of the broadband Internet infrastructure
