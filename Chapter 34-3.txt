Biden added more jobs to the economy than Trump, Obama, or Bush - Axios reports.

"On the one hand, they're both working to expand employment. On the other, the fact that the president is so unpopular is just a fact of life," Biden said.

Republicans have been vocal about their opposition to the president's healthcare reform plan.

A spokesman for Trump has said that Republicans should not vote for a bill during a closed-door meeting with House Republicans.

"We're working diligently to get this done with the help of our House colleagues and with the support of our own members," Ben Ray Luce said in a statement.

Trump in March proposed a healthcare reform bill that would have required insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions, which would have cost the federal government $1 trillion over the next decade.

"The president has not yet committed to supporting such a bill," he told reporters in February. "We are working with those who are working to make sure that the American people have access to the health care they need."
