South Korea authorities seek arrest of Yoon over martial law declaration - Al Jazeera English

Kuala Lumpur: Two men were detained in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday for allegedly being involved in a "illegal assembly" on a military base, a senior police official said on Thursday.

The men, aged between 22 and 24, were arrested at the border with Malaysia on March 21 along with two Malaysian police officers, the official said.

They were detained for the alleged involvement of a "national security" commission, he said.

The official said the men had been detained while travelling to China to attend a rally planned for March 28 in Jalan Sui, a city in southern China's Fiery Cross region.

They were detained in connection with a planned rally in the Fiery Cross region, which is controlled by China, and were arrested in the Fiery Cross area, where there are significant military bases.

Chinese officials have been keen to prevent tensions between China and the West from escalating into a further flare-up.

The two men were detained on March 21 along with two Malaysian police officers, the official said.

Malaysia's National Security Council (NSC) said it was working with the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak to hold the men to account.

It also said the three wanted were being held without charge in China "without further charge".
